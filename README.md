# Workshop-React-Native

Hello :)
This workshop is an introduction to React Native using [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) where we will learning how to fetch data from and an API and displaying its content! (I know, exciting)
For that, we will be creating a weather app with the [openweatherapi](https://openweathermap.org/api), which is a provider of highly recognisable weather products that make working with the weather data a way easier. 

Without further ado, let's get started with the installations!
